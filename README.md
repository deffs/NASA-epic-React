# NASA-epic-React

Easy:
  1. Setting up the views
  2. Making the network request and handling async
  3. Fast refreshing/updates
  4. Connecting views with model code

Hard:
  1. Parsing the JSON for the photo url (where can you actually use variables? and what is the scope?)
  2. Dealing with bugs/general debugging
  3. Ensuring compatability for various devices
  4. Understanding the different components of the system
  5. Navigation?
  6. Too much HTML (I like Storyboards)
  7. Setting up the development environment without bugs since it changes so quickly
  8. Rendering a shadow
  9. Incorporating more complex user interactions
  
How I Overcame Difficulties:
  1. Breaks
  2. StackOverFlow
  3. React Documentation
  4. Youtube Videos
  5. Trying to solve problems from multiple directions
  
What I Learned:
  1. Javascript is more confusing than I previously thought
  2. React is quite powerful, but has its limitations
  3. How much I underappreciate Native iOS
  4. I should take a React Native course to acutally understand what is going on in the code
